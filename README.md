# Dictionary App

The Project Name is a Dictionary App which was built to easen up the searching of any english word. The App is expected to give a valuable feedback on the meaning of the searched word and its pronunciation. 

## Core Deliverables

As a user, I can:

1. See a search input and a search button where i can type any english Word that i wish to know and return a feedback.

2. if the Search word is a valid english word, the feedback will contain the meaning of the word, its pronunciation both in words and audio. Some words will go an extra mile in giving an example on how to use the word in a sentence.

3. Incase the searched word is not a valid word, then the user will be notified by an error message which says "Couldn't Find The Word".
